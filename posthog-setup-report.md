# PostHog post-wizard report

The wizard has completed a deep integration of PostHog analytics into the START Munich Next.js 15.3 App Router project. PostHog is initialized via `instrumentation-client.ts` (the recommended approach for Next.js 15.3+), with a reverse proxy configured in `next.config.js` to route all PostHog ingestion through `/ingest` on the same domain for improved ad-blocker resistance and performance. Environment variables are stored in `.env.local`. Eight client-side events have been instrumented across six files, covering the full application funnel, navigation CTAs, startup browsing, and partner contact actions.

| Event | Description | File |
|---|---|---|
| `application_started` | User clicks 'Start Application' (hero card or bottom CTA) | `app/join-start/2026/JoinStartClient.tsx` |
| `application_event_registration_clicked` | User clicks 'Register now' on an event tile on the apply page | `app/join-start/2026/JoinStartClient.tsx` |
| `nav_apply_clicked` | User clicks 'Apply Now' in the navigation bar (desktop or mobile) | `components/Navigation.tsx` |
| `nav_jobs_clicked` | User clicks 'Jobs' in the navigation bar (desktop or mobile) | `components/Navigation.tsx` |
| `event_card_clicked` | User clicks a flagship event card or the featured event CTA on the Events page | `app/events/EventsContent.tsx` |
| `startup_card_clicked` | User clicks a startup card to view startup details | `app/startups/StartupCard.tsx` |
| `startup_website_clicked` | User clicks 'Visit Website' on a startup details page | `app/startup-details/[id]/StartupDetailsContent.tsx` |
| `partner_contact_clicked` | User clicks 'Get in Touch' on the For Partners page | `app/for-partners/PartnerCTAButton.tsx` (used in `app/for-partners/page.tsx`) |

### Agent skill

We've left an agent skill folder in your project. You can use this context for further agent development when using Claude Code. This will help ensure the model provides the most up-to-date approaches for integrating PostHog.
