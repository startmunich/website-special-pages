                Registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after registering, you will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with other people&apos;s e-mail addresses. Subscriptions to the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process in accordance with legal requirements. This includes storing the time of registration and confirmation as well as the IP address.
